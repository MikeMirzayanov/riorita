# [Riorita](https://github.com/MikeMirzayanov/riorita)

Simple C++-server to store byte arrays by key, uses leveldb as a backend

It is written using C++ on the top of boost::asio::io_service. Also contains Java client implementation.

On Ubuntu you can install requirements with `apt install g++ libsnappy-dev libleveldb-dev librocksdb-dev libboost-all-dev`

## Protocol

Riorita uses a very simple binary request-response protocol. It supports keep-alive out-of-the-box, a client should connect to the
server via TCP and send requests. The client receives a response after each request.

The server closes a connection on any error, a client can reopen a connection.

Protocol uses LITTLE_ENDIAN byte order.

### Requests

There three types of requests:

Type       | Byte value | Description                           | Parameters                       |    Return value
-----------|------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------
`PING`     |  1 | Just ping a server to be sure that it is alive | No parameters           |    verdict is always 1
`HAS`      |  2 | Checks that server has value by given key | String key            |    verdict is 1 if has and 0 if has no
`GET`      |  3 | Returns value by given key | String key            |    verdict is 1 if the server contains value by key or 0 in opposite case
`PUT`      |  4 | Puts value by given key, overwrites existing data | String key, byte[] value            |    verdict is always 1
`DELETE`   |  5 | Deletes data by given key | String key            |    verdict is always 1

Each request has a form:

`<total-request-size:4><magic-byte:1><protocol-version:1><request-type-byte-value:1><request-id:8>` + `<key-length:4><key-data:key-length>`

where `:x` stands for the length of a field in bytes. Operator `+` stands for simple concatenation and used just to break long line.

Also if type is `PUT` the request is appended with:

`<value-length:4><value-data:value-length>`

For `PING` request the key should be empty (key-length=0).

### Responses

Each response returns at least one boolean field: success, where success equals to 1
if and only if the request has been processed without unexpected errors. If success=1 then
a response contains verdict (equals to 0 or 1), it stands for the result of operation.

Each response has a form:

`<total-response-size:4><magic-byte:1><protocol-version:1><request-id:8><success:1>`

If success=1 the response is appended with:

`<verdict:1>`

If request type was `GET` and verdict=1 then the response is appended with:

`<value-length:4><value-data:value-length>`
